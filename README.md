# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

This repository serves as a foundational guide for setting up and working with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum and is designed to help learners build modern, responsive web applications using best practices in project structure, styling, and component design.

Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- Scaffolding a Next.js app using TypeScript and Tailwind
- Building reusable components
- Implementing page-based routing
- Fetching and displaying data from external APIs
- Managing component props and state

By the end of this project, you'll have a clean, well-organized Next.js application that demonstrates the core skills required for full-stack development using modern tools and practices.
